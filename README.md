## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Ali Dahir's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! Here you'll find details about my skills, projects, and experience as an Electrical Engineer.

## About Me
I'm an Electrical Engineer with expertise in FPGA design, ASIC verification, and embedded systems development. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my problem-solving skills and push the boundaries of technology.

## Projects
- **Hardware Based Timer  (FPGA Basys 3 Xilinx, Verilog HDL, Vivado)**: [GitHub Link]
  	- Designed and implemented a hardware-based timer using Verilog HDL, integrated IP cores for clock management, and optimized design constraints.
	- Developed a state-machine-based control system to handle timer operations.
	- Simulated and verified logic using Vivado to reduce power consumption.

- **Autonomous Maze Solving Car  (C, Arduino, Embedded Systems)**: Source Code [GitHub Link] + Video [Youtube]
  	- Developed an Arduino-controlled robot for autonomous maze navigation.
	- Implemented ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and real-time path planning.
	- Programmed state-machine logic for movement (left/right/forward/backward).
	- Fine-tuned sensor thresholds for accurate decision-making and obstacle avoidance.

- **GUI Modelling Software (Python, Tkinter)**: [GitHub Link] 
	- Built a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for high-frequency neural network modeling.
	- Integrated real-time visualization of AI model performance.
	- Managed data flow integration between UI and neural network back-end.
